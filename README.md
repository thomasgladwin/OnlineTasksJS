# OnlineTasksJS
This is a tutorial for programming online psychological tasks in JavaScript from scratch. The idea is to provide all the necessary technical bits and some handy programming patterns to adjust to your own tasks.

The file JSTasksHighlighted.pdf is a little less hardcore than the initial version, as most added code is now bolded, but no guarantees - the idea is still to run through and compare new and old code.
